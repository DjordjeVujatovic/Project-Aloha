# Project 1 Part 1 - Aloha Homepage

## Summary

For our first project at Red Academy we built the homepage of an e-commerce website, Aloha Apparel, using HTML and CSS. 

## Languages and Tools Used
	* HTML
	* CSS (including CSS reset styles, floats, and media queries)
	* Git and Github 

## What did I learn?

During this project I learned and honed both my HTML and CSS skills, in addition to learning how to command my terminal, use git, as well as Github. Though floats and media queries proved to be a bit challenging at first, I can say now with confidence that I have greatly strengthened my HTML and CSS skills.
